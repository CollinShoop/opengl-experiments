# OpenGL Experiments

This project is a collection of stuff that was made in the process of casually learning how to do computer graphics
in OpenGL (in Kotlin specifically because why not?).

Nothing here will be perfect so please keep that in mind if future readers decide to use any code in this project as 
an example.
